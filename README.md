Fidel Castro takes blame for 1960s gay persecution...“We had so many and such terrible problems, problems of life or death,” Castro said.

“In those moments I was not able to deal with that matter (of homosexuals). I found myself immersed, principally, in the Crisis of October (Cuban Missile Crisis), in the war, in policy questions,” he said.

Official persecution of gays continued into the 1970s before homosexual acts were decriminalized in 1979. Today, Cuba’s medical service provides free sex-change operations.

It marks a big moment for Cuba, which saw gay people persecuted and sent to work camps in the 1960s and 70s.
However, there was significant opposition to the reforms among religious groups and conservatives.”
